# CloudLockr â€” TypeScript Express.js Server

CloudLockr is an innovative data storage system. This repo contains the backend server code, 
which accepts requests from both the React Native application and the DE1 firmware to
facilitates user authentication, file management, and database CRUD operations.

### Main Technologies

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- TypeORM
- Redis
- Jest

## Execution Details

### Running Server Locally
1. Clone this repository and cd into it
2. Create a `.env` file in directory which contains `package.json` and fill in the following fields
  - `NODE_ENV={server state, probably "dev"}`
  - `PORT={desired server port}`
  - `DB_URL={URL of dockerized postgres development database, port must be 5433 to match docker-compose.yml}`
  - `DB_AUTH_TEST_URL={URL of dockerized postgres integration test database 0, expect to be similar to DB_URL except database name is different}`
  - `DB_FILE_TEST_URL={URL of dockerized postgres integration test database 1, expect to be similar to DB_URL except database name is different}`
  - `REDIS_PORT=6000`
  - `TOKEN_SECRET={your access token secret}`
  - `REFRESH_SECRET={your refresh token secret}`
3. Create a `database.env` file in the same directory and fill in the following fields such that they match the `.env DB_URL` field
  - `POSTGRES_USER={matching username as DB_URL}`
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD={matching password as DB_URL}`
  - `POSTGRES_DB={matching database as DB_URL}`
4. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d`
5. Run `yarn install`
6. Run `yarn build && yarn start`
  - The server should now be started, please refer to [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for instructions on how to call server API endpoints

### Running Tests
1. Create the 2 dockerized PostgreSQL test databases, matching `DB_AUTH_TEST_URL` and `DB_FILE_TEST_URL`
2. Run `yarn test`
  - Or run `yarn test --coverage` to see test coverage, should be 100% statement and branch coverage except for `src/index.ts` and `src/config/*.ts`, as these are configuration files for the server, and the test files have their own configuration
